This is a group project for Analysis of Algorithms Course prepared with (https://github.com/omerkibar).

The aim of this project is to compare different sorting algorithms for finding the k'th smallest element of an unsorted list of n numbers.

We have examined all variations:

- different values of n,
- different values of k (1, n/2, n),
- different characteristics of the list (almost sorted, reversely sorted etc.)

After these examinations, we came up with the comparison of the complexities of different algorithms.
